ðŸ‘‰This code creates a simple calculator that you can use in a web browser. The calculator has buttons for numbers, basic operations (like addition and subtraction), and a display to show the input and result.

Structure Overview
HTML: This is the skeleton of the web page.
CSS: This styles the web page, making it look nice.
JavaScript: This makes the calculator work by responding to button clicks.

The calculator works based on the onclick() in javascript.
On pressing differnt buttons the display will add differnt things.
like press 1 then it adds 1 to the display like a way same goes to the numbers from 00,0 to 9 and operators are displaced when buttons like +,-,/,* 
pressed.
finally when the equal operator '=' is pressed then it evaluates the string in the display using "eval(display.value)".
eval() is a JavaScript function that takes a string as an argument and executes it as JavaScript code. 
The current value of the display, which is a string representing the mathematical expression (like "3+5*2"), is accessed using display.value.
The result of the evaluation is assigned back to display.value, so it gets shown on the calculator display.
